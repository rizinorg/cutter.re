Cutter is a Qt and C++ GUI powered by [Rizin](https://rizin.re). Its goal is making an advanced, customizable and FOSS reverse-engineering platform while keeping the user experience at mind. Cutter is created by reverse engineers for reverse engineers.

Cutter is actively maintained by its developer team and releases a new feature every ~5 weeks. Naturally, Cutter enjoys the fast paced development of its core, Rizin. This makes the project one of the most actively developed RE frameworks.
