<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/inetgrating-the-rizin-mark-api-rsoc/mark-complete.gif" alt="Mark Complete" /></p>

<p>You can find the write-up of my first project <a href="https://cutter.re/shortcut-manager-rsoc">here</a></p>

<h2 id="what-are-marks">What Are Marks</h2>

<p><strong>Marks</strong> in Rizin let you label a range of memory addresses with a name, comment, or even a color. They’re a way to keep track of important regions in a binary.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="https://rizin.re/posts/rsoc-2025-mark-api/">RSoC 2025 - Adding Mark API</a> for more details about <strong>Marks</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>For now, <strong>Marks</strong> are only available in the <strong>Hexdump</strong> widget</p>

<h3 id="adding-editing-and-removing-marks">Adding, Editing and Removing Marks</h3>

<p>To make working with marks more user-friendly, we introduced a dedicated dialog in Cutter. This dialog, implemented in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MarkDialog</code>, takes user input and communicates with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Core()</code> instance to add or edit marks. Through it, users can visually set the start and end addresses, give the mark a name, add a comment, and even pick a color.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/inetgrating-the-rizin-mark-api-rsoc/mark-add-dialog.png" alt="Add mark dialog box" /></p>

<p>Actions for adding, editing, and removing marks are integrated into the context menu.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/inetgrating-the-rizin-mark-api-rsoc/mark-context-menu.png" alt="Context menu actions for marks" /></p>

<p>A default shortcut key <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> was also introduced in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DefaultShortcuts</code> to quickly trigger the <strong>Add Mark</strong> action.</p>

<h3 id="visualizing-marks">Visualizing Marks</h3>

<p>Once adding and editing marks was in place, the next step was to give them a proper visual representation. This happens directly inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hexdump</code> widget. Before drawing the <strong>Data bytes</strong> and <strong>ASCII</strong> characters, the widget first queries the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Core()</code> instance for all mark items that overlap with the current <strong>viewport</strong>. These are collected in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MarkDescription</code> container.</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">MarkDescription</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">RVA</span> <span class="n">from</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">RVA</span> <span class="n">to</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">QString</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">QString</span> <span class="n">realname</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">QString</span> <span class="n">comment</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">QColor</span> <span class="n">color</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each mark is then rendered in its assigned color, and finally the <strong>Data bytes</strong> and <strong>ASCII</strong> characters are drawn on top so the marks integrate smoothly into the <strong>Hexdump</strong> view.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/inetgrating-the-rizin-mark-api-rsoc/mark-highlight.png" alt="Two highlighted marks" /></p>

<h3 id="blending-overlapping-marks">Blending Overlapping Marks</h3>

<p>To handle <strong>overlapping Marks</strong>, their colors are blended to create a combined color for the overlapping region. This is achieved by setting the alpha of each mark’s color to <strong>50%</strong>, allowing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QPainter</code> object to automatically mix them when drawing the overlapped areas.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/inetgrating-the-rizin-mark-api-rsoc/mark-highlight-overlap.png" alt="Two highlighted overlapping marks" /></p>

<p>Here, the <strong>overlapping</strong> region is highlighted by a subtle green color.</p>

<h3 id="tooltip">Tooltip</h3>

<p>To help distinguish between different marks, we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QToolTip</code>. When the user hovers over a marked address, a <strong>tooltip</strong> appears showing a small colored circle along with the mark’s name.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/inetgrating-the-rizin-mark-api-rsoc/mark-tooltip.png" alt="Single mark tooltip" /></p>

<p>If <strong>multiple</strong> marks overlap at the same address, the tooltip lists them all line by line, with priority given to the most recently added mark.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/inetgrating-the-rizin-mark-api-rsoc/mark-tooltip-overlap.png" alt="Overlapping marks tooltip" /></p>

<p>The <strong>tooltip</strong> is designed to follow the cursor. This was achieved with a small trick: first set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QToolTip</code> text to the intended text plus a trailing space, and then immediately update it with the actual text. This forces Qt to redraw the tooltip at the new cursor position while keeping the content unchanged.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/inetgrating-the-rizin-mark-api-rsoc/mark-tooltip-animation.gif" alt="Mark tooltip animation" /></p>

<h3 id="removing-and-editing-overlapping-marks">Removing and Editing Overlapping Marks</h3>

<p>Since our feature now supports overlapping marks, we needed a way to remove or edit a mark that is completely contained inside another mark. Previously, the only way to access such a mark was by first removing the marks on top of it and then re-adding them, which was inconvenient.</p>

<p>To solve this, the <strong>Remove</strong> and <strong>Edit</strong> actions in the context menu now list all of the marks present at the selected address along with their names. This allows the user to directly choose which mark to edit or remove without disturbing the others.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/inetgrating-the-rizin-mark-api-rsoc/mark-remove-overlap.png" alt="Remove mark submenu" /></p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>Everything worked fine until we hit an issue: whenever the cursor moved inside a highlighted mark range, the background reverted to Cutter’s default color instead of staying with the mark’s highlight. This happened because the cursor redraw overwrote the background each time it moved.</p>

<p>If there was only one mark at the cursor address, fixing this would be easy: just query the mark and repaint the background with its color. But since multiple marks can overlap at the same address, we needed a smarter approach. To solve this, we introduced a helper function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getBlendedMarksColorAt()</code> inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CutterCore</code>, which calculates the final blended color for all marks at a given address.</p>

<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>

<p>A cool idea for future work could be to create another tab alongside the <strong>Parsing</strong> and <strong>Information</strong> tabs in the right panel, dedicated to <strong>Marks</strong>.
This tab would display all added marks in a table-like view with their names and allow quick interaction.</p>

<p>Clicking on a mark would open its details (such as comment, color, etc.) and provide options to directly edit or remove it without needing to use the right-click context menu.
Additionally, double-clicking on a row could automatically move the <strong>cursor</strong> and <strong>viewpoint</strong> to the starting address of the selected mark, making navigation much faster and more intuitive.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/inetgrating-the-rizin-mark-api-rsoc/mark-future-improvement.png" alt="Right pane highlighted with arrow and red box" /></p>

<p>And also extend <strong>Marks</strong> support to different widgets (Disassembly, Graph, etc.).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The integration of the Rizin Mark API in Cutter enables adding, editing, and managing overlapping marks directly in the Hexdump. With tooltips and context menu actions, it streamlines annotating binaries while leaving room for future enhancements.</p>

<p>Greetings! I’m Emad Sohail (aka PremadeS), a 2nd-year CS undergraduate student at Information Technology University - Lahore. You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/PremadeS">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emad-sohail-130b3b265/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>This summer I worked on improving the user experience of Cutter.</p>

<p>This was the first project. The main objective of this project was to introduce a universal <strong>Shortcut Manager</strong> in Cutter and provide a flexible setup that can support custom shortcuts in the future with minimal additions.</p>

<p>You can find the write-up of my second project <a href="https://cutter.re/integrating-the-rizin-mark-api-rsoc">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-shortcut-manager">Why a Shortcut Manager</h2>

<p>Default key sequences, <em>also referred to here as shortcuts</em>, were previously defined in their respective classes. While this approach works if the codebase is small, it becomes exceptionally difficult to manage as the project grows, making it hard to keep track of which shortcuts are assigned to which functions. On top of that, because the key sequences were scattered across different files, there was no way to create a centralized view that allows the user to see the default shortcuts and their respective actions.</p>

<h2 id="design-goals">Design Goals</h2>

<p>The <strong>Shortcut Manager</strong> was designed with three key goals:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Consistency:</strong> Shortcuts should behave uniformly across the application, regardless of whether they originate from a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QAction</code> or a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QShortcut</code>.
2) <strong>Maintainability:</strong> All default shortcuts must be in the same place, allowing developers to quickly add, remove, or edit key sequences without needing to look through multiple files.
3) <strong>Extensibility:</strong> The system should provide a solid foundation that can be expanded in the future, enabling features like custom user-defined shortcuts.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>Default key sequences are stored in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shortcut</code> struct, each mapped to a unique ID within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shortcuts/DefaultShortcuts</code> using a <strong>hashmap</strong>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shortcut</code> struct holds both the key sequence and a descriptive text string, along with a context string that is particularly useful for translations.</p>

<p>Whenever a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QAction</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QShortcut</code> inside any class wants to register a key sequence, it queries the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ShortcutManager</code> class through a singleton object defined by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shortcuts()</code>, using the unique ID.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ShortcutManager</code> then looks up the corresponding entry in the default shortcuts map. If a matching ID exists, it returns the associated key sequence; if not, it logs a warning and returns an empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QKeySequence</code> object.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/shortcut-manager-rsoc/shortcut-registering-flowchart.png" alt="Shortcut manager process flowchart" /></p>

<p>To make the process even simpler, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ShortcutManager</code> also provides utility methods that return fully configured <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QAction</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QShortcut</code> objects based on the given ID. This not only streamlines shortcut creation but also hides the underlying complexity, keeping the codebase clean and consistent.</p>

<p>A Default Shortcuts widget has also been introduced, allowing users to easily view all default key sequences alongside their corresponding actions. It also includes a search bar, making it simple to quickly find specific shortcuts or actions. <a href="https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/pull/3504/">PR #3504</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/shortcut-manager-rsoc/shortcut-widget-filter.gif" alt="Cutter Shortcut Filter" /></p>

<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>

<p>While the <strong>Shortcut Manager</strong> already improves consistency and maintainability, it also lays the groundwork for more advanced functionality:</p>

<p><strong>Custom Shortcuts:</strong> In the future, users will be able to define and register their own shortcuts through Cutter’s interface.</p>

<p><strong>Profiles and Configurations:</strong> A logical next step would be to allow different sets of shortcuts for different profiles or workflows, making it easier to switch between tailored setups.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The introduction of the <strong>Shortcut Manager</strong> marks an important step in making Cutter more user-friendly and maintainable. By centralizing shortcuts, we’ve eliminated fragmentation in the codebase while also opening the door to future enhancements. While the project itself was relatively small in terms of code changes and complexity, its impact and long-term benefits are substantial.</p>]]></content><author><name>Emad Sohail</name></author><category term="Cutter" /><category term="Shortcuts" /><category term="RSoC" /><category term="Shortcuts" /><category term="RSoC" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing a centralized Shortcut Manager in Cutter for improved consistency and maintainability.

<p>We are excited to release Cutter v2.0 — the first release of Cutter that is using <a href="https://rizin.re">Rizin</a> as its core backend. Since forking radare2 and creating Rizin, we invested countless hours in improving the projects feature, overall stability, and the way we work. Releasing Cutter 2.0 is a significant milestone for us, as we believe that the recent improvements we made to our core — Rizin, and to Cutter itself, are the starting point of creating a better reverse engineering software.</p>

<p>Many of you waited for our first release with Rizin, and now the time has finally arrived. In this post, we note down some of the recent changes we have made to Cutter and what you should expect to see in this new release. To view the detailed changelog or download Cutter 2.0,
check out the <a href="https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/releases/tag/v2.0.0">release on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h1 id="highlights">Highlights</h1>

<h2 id="saving-and-loading-your-work-with-projects">Saving and loading your work with Projects</h2>

<p>During reverse-engineering sessions, it is crucial to be able to keep track of the gained knowledge through annotations such as comments, function and variable names. As such, the tool one is working with also needs to provide a reliable and future-proof way to save and restore this information. This functionality was deeply important to us and to our users and was requested by the community often.</p>

<p>Up to this release, Cutter had only a basic and unreliable support for saving the user’s work in projects, a functionality provided by radare2. When Rizin was forked from radare2, the team decided to create a reliable mechanism of saving and loading projects from scratch. The technical details of this newly created projects feature are described in a <a href="https://rizin.re/posts/introducing-projects/">dedicated post published in rizin’s blog</a>.</p>

<p>Cutter 2.0 introduces full support for Projects, and you can now save and load you work seamlessly. The feature is in beta support that will last until the first major release of Rizin (v1.0).</p>

<p>By the way, because Cutter directly uses Rizin’s project format, projects created in command-line Rizin can be directly loaded in Cutter and vice-versa, giving you the possibility to change between both tools whenever you want.</p>

<h3 id="saving-a-project">Saving a project</h3>

<p>Saving your work in a project is simple and intuitive. Click on the “File” menu and choose “Save Project” or “Save Project As”. This will open a dialog that will ask you where do you want to save the new project. The extension for Rizin and Cutter projects is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.rzdb</code>.</p>

<p>Those of you who wish to use keyboard shortcuts can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl + S</code> to save the project. You can use these shortcuts many times during your work to save the changes to the project file.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/cutter-2.0/save-project-menu.png" alt="Save Project Menu" />
</figure>

<h3 id="loading-projects">Loading projects</h3>

<p>Opening projects in Cutter can be done in two ways. The first one, is from the Projects tab in Cutter’s opening dialog. To do this, open Cutter and click on the Projects tab. In there, you will see the recent projects you created or loaded. Double-click on a project, or click “select” and choose another project file from the dialog.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/cutter-2.0/open-project-dialog.png" alt="Open Project Dialog" style="max-height: 500px;" />
</figure>

<p>The second option to open a project in Cutter is via the command line. To do this, run Cutter with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--project</code> flag:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cutter -p demo.rzdb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="cutter-now-supports-reverse-debugging">Cutter now supports Reverse Debugging</h2>

<p>Another feature that we’re very excited about in this release is the addition of reverse debugging to all debug backends, including remote and ESIL. Reverse debug allows you to move the program counter backwards and revert the program state to the saved state at that point.</p>

<p>The debug toolbar now includes the option to start a ‘trace session’ that enables reverse debug:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/cutter-2.0/debug-toolbar.png" alt="Debug Toolbar" />
</figure>

<p>Once you start a trace session, Cutter begins recording the program’s memory and register changes from the current program counter. This allows you to step backwards and continue backwards to restore the program’s state up to the trace session’s first recorded instruction:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/cutter-2.0/debug-toolbar-started.png" alt="Debug Toolbar while Debugging" />
  <figcaption>From right to left - stop trace session, continue backwards and step backwards</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When stepping or continuing back, we locate the target instruction in the recorded session and revert the state of the registers and memory up to that point. It’s important to note that Cutter doesn’t handle non-deterministic events like signals or syscalls.</p>

<p><strong>Continuing back to the future</strong></p>

<p>Similarly to regular continue, backwards continue currently only stops due to an interrupt (by clicking on the “suspend process” button) or a breakpoint. Otherwise, it will continue all the way back to the session’s first instruction.</p>

<p>Since Cutter stops at every instruction to record memory and register changes while continuing, this may significantly slow down the traversal between two points. To solve this issue, we have also added the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dbg.trace_continue</code>(default=true) flag to the debug settings. This flag allows the user to save the program’s state only between two states: the first state is the original program counter position before continue, and the second is the destination of the run. This means that stepping backwards will also return to the last recorded point before continue as illustrated:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/cutter-2.0/debug-trace-continue-false.png" alt="dbg.trace_continue=false" />
  <figcaption>Continue with <code class="highlighter-rouge">dbg.trace_continue=false</code></figcaption>

<h2 id="improving-the-renaming-workflow">Improving the renaming workflow</h2>

<p>Last year, we asked you what are the things you want to see improved in Cutter. Many of you mentioned that the basic workflow of renaming isn’t user-friendly and can be improved. And indeed, during the recent months we worked on improving it and created an easier renaming workflow in which you can press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> in many places in the disassembly to rename functions, flags, and more. You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> to add new flags in certain addresses.</p>

<p>There are more improvement to do when it comes to renaming in Cutter, such as having better support for renaming symbols and renaming information in the decompiler. We plan to improve these areas in future releases.</p>

<h2 id="basic-block-headers-in-graph-view">Basic block headers in Graph view</h2>

<p>A new feature that was added in Cutter v2.0 is the option to display the basic blocks offsets in the Graph view. When enabled, each basic block will have its start-address displayed at the top. This feature can be enabled or disabled from the preferences view: Edit → Preferences → Disassembly → Graph → Show offset of the first instruction in each graph block.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/cutter-2.0/bb-headers.png" alt="Basic Block Headers" />
</figure>

<h2 id="hover-on-address-to-view-its-content">Hover on address to view its content</h2>

<p>The functions widget of Cutter had a functionality that allowed the user to preview the contents of a function by hovering with their mouse on a function name from the list. Now, in our new release, we expanded this feature and added support for previewing the contents of a function, flag or address, by hovering on them in the disassembly view. This will allow you to quickly view data and code in target address, without navigating to this address.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/blog/posts/cutter-2.0/hover-addr.png" alt="Hover on address" />
</figure>

<h2 id="new-comment-column-in-multiple-table-views">New Comment Column in multiple Table Views</h2>

<p>We improved multiple table view widgets to now display comments that are being added in these addresses. For example, if the user added a comment to an offset of a string, or of a flag, the comments will be displayed in the list.</p>

I am a second-year CS undergraduate student at IIIT Hyderabad, India. This summer, I participated in a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> project for <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/">radareorg</a>. The main goal of my project is to improve the decompiler interface in Cutter.</p>

<p>As a part of my project, I worked on multiple repositories, including <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/cutter/">Cutter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/r2ghidra-dec/">r2ghidra-dec</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/">radare2</a>. I have also sent a couple of patches to the <a href="https://github.com/avast/retdec-r2plugin">retdec-r2plugin</a>. The following sections sum up the important work that I have done and its impacts. Each section will describe specific features or important API that I have worked on. It will also have links to the code and discussions related to that topic.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-standard-decompiler-interface">Creating a standard decompiler interface</h2>

<p>Cutter’s decompiler didn’t have a good enough decompiler interface for supporting context-sensitive actions. A basic structure named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RAnnotatedCode</code> and some useful API functions were already present in r2ghidra-dec for storing the information we get from the Ghidra decompiler.</p>

<p>After discussions in the community, we decided to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RAnnotatedCode</code> as the standard decompiler interface across all the decompilers used in Cutter and Radare2. The related work involved shifting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RAnnotatedCode</code> API from r2ghidra-dec to radare2. I also implemented unit tests for API functions related to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RAnnotatedCode</code>.</p>

<p>Currently, Cutter supports three decompilers: <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/r2ghidra-dec">R2Ghidra</a>(plugin for Ghidra), <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/r2dec-js">R2Dec</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/avast/retdec-r2plugin">RetDec-Radare2</a>(plugin for RetDec). The output from all these decompilers was being parsed into a custom structure named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AnnotatedCode</code> to use in Cutter.  Even then, internally, r2ghidra-dec and retdec-radare2 used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RAnnotatedCode</code>. After I shifted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RAnnotatedCode</code> to radare2, I sent patches to both r2ghidra-dec and retdec-radare2 to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RAnnotatedCode</code> directly from radare2.</p>

<h2 id="allow-cutter-to-use-rannotatedcode-for-the-decompiler">Allow Cutter to use RAnnotatedCode for the decompiler</h2>

<p>This involved refactoring the decompiler widget to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RAnnotatedCode</code> instead of the custom <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AnnotatedCode</code> it has been using. Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RAnnotatedCode</code> will enable Cutter to have more data about the decompiled code that is essential for implementing a dedicated context menu. I also refactored the decompiler plugins (r2dec, r2ghidra-dec, r2retdec) to emit RAnnotatedCode directly to Cutter.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-a-skeleton-for-the-decompiler-context-menu">Implementing a skeleton for the decompiler context menu</h2>

<p>This involves me making a context-menu with a single action for the decompiler. I replaced the disassembly context menu completely in the decompiler widget. The only action implemented along with the context menu skeleton was an action to copy selected decompiled code.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-actions-for-debugging">Implementing actions for debugging</h2>
<p>This involved me implementing actions for toggling breakpoint, accessing the menu for advanced breakpoint definition, and also for two other debugging related actions in the decompiler context menu. Multiple breakpoints could exist in a decompiled code line, as that’s often a more straightforward representation of multiple lines in assembly. The option to choose the breakpoint that a user wants to edit from the breakpoints list was also implemented.</p>

<p>This involved introducing a new type of annotation for function names in radare2 and implementing an annotator to annotate function names in r2ghidra-dec. I have also implemented a rename function action along with these. Other actions are implemented using this annotation. They will be shown in later sections.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-annotations-for-global-variables-constant-variables-and-related-actions">Implementing annotations for global variables, constant variables, and related actions</h2>
<p>This involved consolidating all references (function names, global variables, and constant variables) under a single structure called a “reference”. Two new annotation types were also introduced to accommodate global variables and constant variables. Also, annotators were implemented for these new types of annotations in r2ghidra-dec.</p>

<p>The decompiled code shown in the decompiler widget represents and refers to specific memory addresses in the binary. The ability to view these addresses in other widgets such as Hexdump or Disassembly can be very handy. For this, I created a “show-in” menu that allows the user to open the address related to the decompiled code under the cursor in other widgets. These other widgets include Hexdump, Graph, and Disassembly. One other related feature that can become useful is opening a reference in another widget. For instance, a function referenced under the cursor can be opened in a new decompiler widget or a graph widget. A targeted show-in menu for references was implemented for this. In this same PR, actions for adding, renaming, and deleting global variable names were implemented. See GIFs below to see the functionality implemented.</p>

<p>Along with these features, actions for copying instruction address and also reference’s address were implemented. The normal copy action was enhanced to copy a highlighted word to the clipboard if there is no text currently selected by the user. In the event where there is no highlighted word or selection, the entire line of code under the cursor will be copied to the clipboard.</p>

<h2 id="synchronized-decompiler-and-enabling-multiple-decompiler-widgets">Synchronized Decompiler and Enabling Multiple Decompiler Widgets</h2>
<p>The existing auto-refresh mechanism with a refresh button was often confusing to users, particularly when the auto-refresh is disabled. In this case, questions like whether renaming a reference or editing instruction in disassembly should reflect on the decompiler were often asked. Moreover, there were multiple benefits to making the decompiler widget a syncable widget like disassembly or graph. These are explained in the issue <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/cutter/issues/2370">#2370</a>. Allowing multiple decompiler widgets to be opened simultaneously will enable users to compare the output of multiple decompilers that Cutter supports, e.g., Ghidra, RetDec, and R2Dec. This was an existing issue <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/cutter/issues/1766">#1766</a>. I solved these two issues. User documentation to the decompiler was also added.</p>

<p>The following image shows two decompiler widgets with different decompilers side by side.

We had to use Cutter to analyse the binary and figure out the encryption algorithms, the keys used for the encryption, and finally write a script to decrypt the png file. Sounds easy, right? Well, it took me a while to figure it out. Let's dissect it.</p>

<p>As a reverse engineer and malware researcher, the tools I use are super important for me. I have invested hours and hours in creating the best malware analysis environment for myself and chose the best tools for me and my needs. For the last two years, radare2 is my go-to tool for a lot of reverse-engineering tasks such as automating RE related work, scripting, CTFing, exploitation and more. That said, I almost never used radare2 for malware analysis, or more accurately, for analysis of malware for Windows.</p>
<p>The main reason was that radare2 command-line interface felt too clumsy, complicated and an over-kill. IDA Pro was simply better for these tasks, a quick inspection of functions, data structures, renaming, commenting, et cetera. It felt more intuitive for me and that what I was searching for while doing malware analysis. And then came Cutter.</p>
